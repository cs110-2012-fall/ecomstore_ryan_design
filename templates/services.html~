	<!-- You're code goes here, save all css modifications to services_style.css
		 DO NOT modify any existing css classes because it could effect other pages that
		 use that class. If you see something you like but needs to be tweaked just a little,
		 just copy the contents, make the tweak, but give it a different name, and save the 
		 new css class into services_style.css
		 Make sure you use unique class names in your css file because about_style.css
		 will be merged with other css files later on.  
		 
		 A few helpful tips that might save you some time
		 1) if you want to add a photo, first save it in ecomstore/templates/images
		 	the path becomes /static/images/<name of file>
		 2) How an element gets placed on the page is determine by not only its own 'position'
		    attribute, but its parent's 'position' attribute as well. Generally you want to
		    place absolute positioned items inside of a parent whose position attribute is relative
		 3) The pages with a '_vs' at the end have the generic bootstrap theme, you can use those as
		 	building blocks if you like, remember, dont edit the bootstrap css files though.
		 4) Feel free to add javascript if you like, theres tons of cool free scripts out online
		    that may just need a few tweaks to fit our page
